## Overview
The **ShoppingSystem** is a simple console application written in C#. It allows users to simulate a shopping experience by adding items to a cart, viewing the cart, removing items, and checking out. Additionally, the program offers the ability to undo the last action performed, whether it's adding or removing an item from the cart.

- **View cart items**: Users can view the items they have added to the cart along with their prices.
- **Remove items**: Users can remove specific items from their cart.
- **Checkout**: Users can proceed to checkout, see the total price of items in the cart, and complete the purchase.
- **Undo last action**: Users can undo their last action (either adding or removing an item).
- **Exit**: Users can exit the application.

## Concepts Used
- **Dictionary**: Used to store available items and their prices.
- **List**: To manage the items added to the cart.
